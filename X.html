            'X.1': '§.I establishes that ethical boundaries (as opposed to ceremonial boundaries from Article VI) govern obedience, hierarchy, and conduct. These boundaries are binding and enforceable—they carry consequences, not just symbolic weight.',
            'X.2': '§.II grounds all judgment in the Foundation (Article IV). Every act of correction serves to restore the consecrated hierarchy—correction is restorative, not punitive. The goal is always to repair sacred order.',
            'X.3': '§.III establishes the three-tiered classification system: (Ⓐ) ERROR—misunderstanding/oversight from sincere effort; correction is verbal instruction and acknowledgment (lightest); (Ⓑ) BREACH—knowing violation while still acknowledging Lord\'s authority; Lord determines proportional correction (medium); (Ⓒ) PROFANATION—attempt to overturn hierarchy or reject Covenant structure; correction is complete withdrawal of communication/privilege + Formal Restoration Ceremony required (most severe). This tiering prevents over-punishment of honest mistakes while addressing serious violations appropriately.',
            'X.4': '§.IV establishes enforcement principles: (Ⓐ) all enforcement aligns with Doctrinal Foundation and Article IV (no arbitrary punishment); (Ⓑ) Lord\'s judgment categorizes transgressions (Lord determines severity); (Ⓒ) Lord alone determines and enacts all consequences (preserves hierarchy). This centralizes enforcement authority while constraining it to Foundation principles.',
            'X.5': '§.V states forgiveness is proportional to contrition—sincere repentance matters. Correction restores right order; once complete, the Covenant continues, bond unbroken though tested and strengthened through trial. This frames correction as ultimately constructive—the bond survives and grows stronger.',
            'X.6': '§.VI introduces the Record of Commands—both parties encouraged to maintain written records of significant commands, standing decrees, and formal rulings. These records provide clarity in uncertainty and testimony to the Covenant\'s living practice. This creates an institutional memory and reduces disputes over what was commanded.'
