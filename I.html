        sentenceExplanations: {
            'I.1': '§.I establishes the scope: all Covenant matters—bond, commands, corrections, discourse—are protected. "Veiled from profane sight" signals that external observation would contaminate what is sacred.',
            'I.2': '§.II sets the prohibition: no revelation to anyone without mutual consent, with a carve-out for legal compulsion. This balances sacred privacy with worldly necessity.',
            'I.3': '§.III invokes the language of desecration and violation. To reveal the Covenant is not merely indiscretion; it is an attack on the foundation itself. This elevates confidentiality to a moral imperative.',
            'I.4': '§.IV uses poetic metaphor—"the flame that burns between them"—to frame Sacred Silence as protective rather than restrictive. External judgment is cast as a threat, and silence as the shield.',
            'I.5': '§.V enforces the principle. Violation is breach, invoking Article X (penalties/consequences). This gives Sacred Silence teeth—it is not advisory but enforceable.'
