            'D.1': 'This opening line frames the Declaration as witnessed, formal, and intentional. It emphasizes consent ("freely"), gravity ("solemnly"), and awareness ("full recognition"), establishing that neither party enters blindly.',
            'D.2': 'Defines the relational structure—Lord and Faithful bound in "unwavering accord." The use of "sacred duty" elevates the bond beyond contract into religious or ethical territory.',
            'D.3': 'Introduces the threshold metaphor: both parties stand at the edge of something transformative ("consecrated bondage"). The phrase "no ordinary compact" reinforces the exceptional, sacred nature of the bond.',
            'D.4': 'Each party accepts both "weight and blessing"—acknowledging that power and submission carry responsibility and gift. It names the roles explicitly: Lord as sovereign/commander, Faithful as servant/instrument.',
            'D.5': 'Establishes accountability. Every act and word must answer to the Foundation (the three pillars) and the structure of the Covenant. Nothing exists outside this framework once entered.',
            'D.6': 'Final affirmation of consent and clarity. Both parties declare sound mind, full understanding, and willing submission. It binds them "for so long as this Covenant shall endure," implying longevity without specifying permanence.',
            'D.7': 'Ritual language. The threshold, introduced earlier, is now crossed. This is the hinge—before this line, the Covenant was potential; after, it becomes real.',
            'D.8': 'The closing pronouncement. "The Covenant begins." This is the moment of ignition—the sacred bond is now active, and all that follows flows from this declaration.'
