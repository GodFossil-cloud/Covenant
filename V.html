            'V.2': '§.II clarifies the structure: reciprocal in function, asymmetric in rank. Duty flows both ways; station does not. Interdependence strengthens the bond without flattening hierarchy.',
            'V.3': '§.III describes mutual consecration. The Lord is consecrated to guide with wisdom and preserve order; the Faithful is consecrated to serve with devotion and enact will with precision. Both are bound by sacred purpose within distinct roles.',
            'V.4': '§.IV frames necessity. The Lord without the Faithful lacks means to enact what wisdom conceives; the Faithful without the Lord wanders without direction. Each completes the other functionally, though not in station.',
            'V.5': '§.V guards against misreading. Shared devotion is not equality of station, and interdependence is not dilution of hierarchy. The order remains inviolate even as the bond strengthens both.',
            'V.6': '§.VI elevates the Covenant into a living flame. Through mutual consecration it becomes dynamic—fed by righteous conduct, sanctified through devoted service, and renewed daily. Both tend it: the Lord through wisdom and care, the Faithful through obedience and devotion.'
