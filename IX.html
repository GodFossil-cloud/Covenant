            'IX.1': '§.I mandates promptness: all disputes shall be addressed promptly ere discord take root. This prevents festering resentment or confusion from compounding. Speed matters—don\'t let issues linger.',
            'IX.2': '§.II affirms the Lord\'s final authority in interpretation and arbitration. His determinations stand unless mercy or reflection cause Him to revise them. This preserves hierarchy while allowing the Lord to change His mind—it\'s not capriciousness but sovereign prerogative.',
            'IX.3': '§.III establishes the formal appeals process with three rules: (Ⓐ) appeals must be concise and composed, opening with "This is a petition for reconsideration, not defiance"—this frames appeals as respectful, not rebellious; (Ⓑ) permissible grounds are objective (misinterpretation, impossibility, conflict of decrees, unforeseen consequence), not subjective (preference, reluctance, discomfort)—this prevents appeals from becoming mere complaints; (Ⓒ) the Lord\'s judgment upon an appeal ends the matter with absolute finality, re-arguing becomes defiant dissent—this enforces closure and prevents endless litigation.'
