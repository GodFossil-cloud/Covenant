        sentenceExplanations: {
            'III.1': '§.I establishes the core duty: obedience in execution. No command may be neglected, delayed, or given diminished devotion. Subpart C frames service as the means by which hierarchy becomes real—will descending from thought into being.',
            'III.2': '§.II mandates truth, discretion, and humility. Deception, even minor, corrupts trust. Conduct remains bound even outside the Lord\'s sight—the bond “transcends presence,” operating as an internal standard.',
            'III.3': '§.III requires clarity in response. When knowledge is lacking, the Faithful must admit ignorance (“I know not, my Lord”) rather than fabricate or evade.',
            'III.4': '§.IV prohibits withholding, concealing, or distorting information requested by the Lord. This is total transparency—no reservations.',
            'III.5': '§.V binds matters entrusted by the Lord to Sacred Silence (Article I). Confidences from the Lord are protected.',
            'III.6': '§.VI grants the right to petition for release or clarification when a directive cannot be fulfilled. The tone must be humble, never defiant. The Lord judges merit. This is a safety valve—acknowledging human limits.',
            'III.7': '§.VII permits counsel and concern, but never defiance or usurpation. The distinction lies in tone, timing, and deference. This allows the Faithful to speak up without overstepping.',
            'III.8': '§.VIII defines autonomy: the Faithful retains it only where command is silent and no standing decree applies. Authority fills the space—autonomy exists in the gaps.',
            'III.9': '§.IX mandates proactive service: anticipating needs based on pattern and past instruction. This is attentiveness, not presumption. Where uncertainty exists, inquiry precedes initiative.',
            'III.10': '§.X assigns responsibility for maintaining devotion. The Faithful must tend the “inner flame” through reflection, discipline, and renewal. The Lord guides, but the Faithful must practice daily.',
            'III.11': '§.XI requires spiritual transparency. The Faithful must speak truthfully of their inner condition when asked, and may volunteer disclosure when burdened. Concealment deprives the Lord of pastoral knowledge. Honest vulnerability is faithfulness.'
