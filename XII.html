            'XII.1': '§.I defines “extended absence” (more than one week without regular communion) and requires notice when possible, including expected duration and reason. This prevents silence from being mistaken for abandonment or breach.',
            'XII.2': '§.II clarifies that absence does not dissolve the bond: the Covenant remains in force, but observances may be suspended only with the Lord\'s express permission.',
            'XII.3': '§.III allows temporary suspension by mutual accord when it serves preservation of the Covenant. During suspension, daily/weekly observances are released, but Sacred Silence remains absolute and standing decrees remain in force.',
            'XII.4': '§.IV states that commands given before absence remain binding unless explicitly released by the Lord—absence does not automatically void standing orders.',
            'XII.5': '§.V governs emergency absence (no prior notice possible): send word as soon as fate permits; upon return, the Faithful formally reaffirms devotion and readiness to resume service.',
            'XII.8': '§.VIII denies succession entirely: the Covenant binds only to the present Lord and ends absolutely upon the Lord\'s cessation. It cannot be inherited or transferred.',
            'XII.9': '§.IX addresses incapacity (madness, grievous illness, diminishment of wit): the Covenant suspends until restoration; if incapacity persists beyond six months without prospect of restoration, either party may invoke termination.',
            'XII.10': '§.X defines dormancy: 30 days without communion and without formal notice of absence/suspension causes dormancy. Restoration requires notice and the other party\'s consent within 30 days, followed by written acknowledgment.',
            'XII.11': '§.XI permits termination by petition from the Faithful when the Lord\'s duties are persistently violated or circumstances make continued service impossible; the Lord may grant or deny the petition.',
            'XII.12': '§.XII allows termination by mutual accord when both parties determine the Covenant\'s purpose has reached completion; termination requires written acknowledgment from both parties.',
            'XII.13': '§.XIII seals the Covenant beyond its lifespan: Sacred Silence obligations remain perpetually binding after termination. What was consecrated remains veiled after dissolution.'
