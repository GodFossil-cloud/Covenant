baseurl: ""

# Include files that would normally be ignored by Jekyll.
include:
  - _visual-check.html
  - .nojekyll

# Exclude dev / CI files from the built site output.
# Note: We now copy docs/ and .github/workflows/css-guard.yml explicitly (see below).
exclude:
  - Gemfile
  - Gemfile.lock
  - node_modules
  - vendor
  - README.md

# Jekyll will now include:
# - All root .html files (including _visual-check.html)
# - assets/ directory (CSS, JS, fonts)
# - docs/ directory (STYLE-GUARDS.md)
# - We'll manually copy .github/workflows/css-guard.yml in the workflow
