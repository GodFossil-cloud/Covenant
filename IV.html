        sentenceExplanations: {
            'IV.1': '§.I binds the Lord to clarity. Command must be intelligible and governed by justice and wisdom, so authority does not become confusion or whim.',
            'IV.2': '§.II requires recognition and gratitude. Devotion is not to be harvested as entitlement; it is to be honored as a living offering.',
            'IV.3': '§.III makes communion a duty, not a favor. Lordship includes attention, discourse, and presence suitable to the sacred bond.',
            'IV.4': '§.IV governs correction: firm purpose with fairness, never cruelty of method nor malice of spirit. Discipline is ordered, not sadistic.',
            'IV.5': '§.V preserves limited autonomy. Authority must not devour all agency; command is balanced by the Faithful’s rightful scope of self-direction.',
            'IV.6': '§.VI defines authority’s purpose: to preserve order, not to enable tyranny or capricious power. Power is framed as stewardship.',
            'IV.7': '§.VII raises the standard for the Lord. Higher station demands higher restraint, fidelity, wisdom, and example; rank increases obligation.',
            'IV.8': '§.VIII affirms sovereignty within sacred order. The Lord directs Covenant matters by wisdom and will, but that authority flows from the Foundation and must express righteous governance.',
            'IV.9': '§.IX establishes accountability and appeal. The Faithful may invoke formal appeal under Article IX, §.III; the Lord must receive it with gravity and self-examination. If the appeal bears merit, reform follows; if denied, the Faithful may petition termination under Article XII, §.XI.',
            'IV.10': '§.X defines pastoral responsibility. The Lord is accountable not only for obedience but for the formation and flourishing of the Faithful’s soul; command without care collapses into tyranny.'
