            'XI.1': '§.I establishes petition and ratification: either party may petition for revision, clarification, or repeal, but only the Lord ratifies amendments. Written acceptance by both parties creates a durable record and removes ambiguity.',
            'XI.2': '§.II requires periodic review at intervals ordained by the Lord. This prevents the Covenant from becoming stale or misapplied, while preserving the Lord’s authority over timing and scope.',
            'XI.3': '§.III sets an unbreakable boundary: no amendment may contradict the Doctrinal Foundation. Any proposal that undermines hierarchy, consecrated order, or mutual consecration is rejected—this is the Covenant’s constitutional limit.',
            'XI.4': '§.IV creates the Codex of Amendments: significant changes are recorded with nature, date, rationale, and acknowledgments. This provides institutional memory and prevents future disputes about what was changed and why.',
            'XI.5': '§.V provides for Covenant Renewal when extensive revision is required: the Lord may declare a full review and re-consecration of the document, treating renewal as a sacred re-binding rather than a casual edit.'
