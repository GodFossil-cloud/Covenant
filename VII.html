        sentenceExplanations: {
            'VII.1': '§.I establishes directional flow for counsel and dispute resolution. Resolution must be sought with justice and remembrance of station. Critically, counsel rises upward from Faithful to Lord—it does not flow laterally (peer-to-peer) nor descends unbidden (Lord imposing unsolicited counsel on self). This preserves hierarchy while allowing the Faithful to raise concerns.',
            'VII.2': '§.II provides resources for uncertainty: Covenant text (literal reference), contemplation (internal reflection), sacred texts consonant with the Foundation (external wisdom aligned with principles), or appointed witness if both parties consent (third-party mediation). This creates pathways for resolution without undermining hierarchy.',
            'VII.3': '§.III establishes seven principles of interpretation: (Ⓐ) Lord\'s intent guides understanding—subjective purpose matters; (Ⓑ) where ambiguity yields equitable options, favor harmonious fulfillment of Lord\'s intent; (Ⓒ) literal reading is baseline, but context/purpose prevail in ambiguity; (Ⓓ) all interpretations must align with Doctrinal Foundation—prevents incoherent readings; (Ⓔ) prior sanctioned interpretations guide present questions—precedent matters; (Ⓕ) most recent explicit statement takes precedence in conflicts—allows updating; (Ⓖ) good faith effort mitigates corrective judgment for misunderstandings—protects sincere failures.',
            'VII.4': '§.IV addresses disputes of fact (not interpretation). Where disagreement exists about whether a command was issued, completed, or what was commanded, resolution proceeds via mutual recitation of facts and consultation of recorded commands. This is factual reconstruction, not interpretive judgment.'
