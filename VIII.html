        sentenceExplanations: {
            'VIII.1': '§.I establishes the sacred nature of commands: they are the living expression of the Lord\'s authority and the Faithful\'s sacred purpose. Commands flow from wisdom and find fulfillment through devoted action. This frames commands as sacred instruments, not mere directives.',
            'VIII.2': '§.II defines the chain of authority through three rules: (Ⓐ) most recent explicit command governs all prior directives unless designated temporary—recency matters; (Ⓑ) standing decrees persist until superseded or revoked—default orders remain in effect; (Ⓒ) where specific and standing both apply, specific governs for that circumstance—context-sensitive override.',
            'VIII.3': '§.III mandates clarification when ambiguity exists. When meaning or scope is unclear, the Faithful shall seek immediate clarification rather than proceed in doubt. This prevents errors from guessing.',
            'VIII.4': '§.IV forbids presumption. To act in uncertainty where clarification can be obtained is to serve presumption, not the Lord. This enforces the clarification requirement—no freelancing allowed.',
            'VIII.5': '§.V requires precision, care, and devotion in execution. Partial fulfillment is incomplete service. Where obstacles arise, report immediately and await guidance. This mandates full execution and proactive communication about problems.',
            'VIII.6': '§.VI addresses conflicts with earthly bonds (employer, kindred, sovereign law). The Faithful must disclose conflicts with full candor before undertaking the command. Concealing such conflict is breach through deception. This protects both parties from legal/practical problems.',
            'VIII.7': '§.VII addresses capacity limits. If a command exceeds present capacity of body or spirit, disclose the limitation with immediate candor before attempting. This prevents harm from overextension and allows the Lord to adjust.',
            'VIII.8': '§.VIII governs time-bound commands: (Ⓐ) they remain fully binding until deadline passes, prioritize completion; (Ⓑ) if unable to meet deadline, petition for extension before deadline passes. This enforces time discipline and requires proactive communication about delays.'
