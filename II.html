            'II.1': '§.I prescribes how the Faithful addresses the Lord: "Lord" or "my Lord." The phrase "formal discourse" signals that this is ceremonial, not casual. The contexts listed—seeking favor, responding to commands, petitioning—are moments of submission or supplication.',
            'II.2': '§.II prescribes how the Lord addresses the Faithful: "Faithful" or "my Faithful." These titles mark station and bond. The reciprocal nature suggests mutual recognition, not unilateral dominance.',
            'II.3': '§.III establishes exclusivity. No one else may be called by these titles within the Covenant. This creates a closed symbolic universe, reinforcing the uniqueness of the bond.',
            'II.4': '§.IV requires solemnity. Titles cannot be spoken in jest, derision, or haste. This frames address as liturgical—worthy of reverence, not frivolity.',
            'II.5': '§.V enforces the rule. Omission or misuse is breach of ceremony, correctable. If motivated by contempt (not mere oversight), it escalates to ethical breach under Article X, §.III. This distinguishes accident from defiance.',
            'II.6': '§.VI introduces discretion. Formal titles are reserved for "sacred discourse"—they need not be used in public. The Lord may waive them when others are present, protecting Sacred Silence. This balances ceremonial rigor with pragmatic flexibility.'
