            'F.1': 'This opening line positions the Foundation not as an arbitrary preference, but as the structural core from which all authority within the Covenant flows. It frames what follows as non-negotiable bedrock.',
            'F.2': 'The first of the three pillars. Declaring hierarchy sacred removes it from the realm of convenience or social construct and elevates it to a metaphysical principle—alignment with divine or cosmic order.',
            'F.3': 'The second pillar. Command is not framed as power seized, but as rightful authority—implying moral legitimacy, not mere force. It ties the exercise of will to justification.',
            'F.4': 'The third pillar. Obedience is not framed as submission under duress, but as an act of devotion. The use of "consecrated" invokes religious ritual—obedience is not servitude but sacrament.',
            'F.5': 'This line acknowledges mutual consent ("freely chosen") while framing the bond as deriving authority from the preceding immutable order, not from negotiation. Choice enters the picture, but only as acceptance of what already exists.',
            'F.6': 'A brief statement that binds power to responsibility. It implies that lordship, when properly enacted, is not tyranny but care—a protective stewardship. This sentence tempers absolute authority with an ethical ideal.',
            'F.7': 'This establishes the Foundation as the interpretive key for all that follows. No Article can be read in isolation—everything refers back to these three principles.',
            'F.8': 'Cements the Foundation as eternal and immutable. Even amendments to the Covenant must bow to this Foundation. It locks the three pillars into place, immune to revision.',
            'F.9': 'A concluding statement that reiterates the Foundation as the generative source of all authority, duty, and structure in the Covenant. It is both origin and anchor.'
