        sentenceExplanations: {
            'I.1': 'The Invocation solves a structural problem: how to establish hierarchy without reducing it to human claim. Three authorities are summoned in descending order—silence (void above all), stars (celestial pattern), Earth (terrestrial witness)—embodying the vertical structure before naming it. This makes ordination, admonition, purification, and declaration possible: each operates within cosmic framework already enacted. Without this opening, the preamble begins with assertion requiring justification. With witness invoked, subsequent language becomes ritual recognition within pre-existing sacred order.',
            'I.2': 'This passage ordains the structure of the Covenant in reflection of the invocation. "Mirror of the firmament" refers to the celestial order in the opening passage—the hierarchy as an existing architecture is directly called to witness before any declarations are made. The hierarchy is already sanctified: the void (Lord), the firmament (Covenant as mediator), the Earth (Faithful). No judge can assert what a witness has proclaimed, because it is already established as-it-is. This transforms the bond from temporal contract into holy sacrament within a pre-existing cosmic order.',
            'I.3': 'This passage of admonition outlines the toll of swearing falsely. "Thereby" creates logical chain: because the structure mirrors the firmament, fabricating oath is desecration of the cosmic plane itself. The passage escalates—betrayal of bond, violation of oath, profanation of order. To swear falsely is to weaponize the fulcrum keeping everything intact. Because witness was invoked and the order sanctified, oath-breaking becomes spiritual transgression, not merely breach of contract.',
            'I.4': 'Purification responds to Admonition\'s warning by expelling corruption from the threshold. Three corruptions are cast out in sequence: deceit must remain unspoken (false speech banned from the sacred space), avarice must be cast into the void (greed expelled entirely), and word and spirit must become one (interior intention matched to exterior utterance). This is the positive counterpart to the warning—where Admonition says "false oaths desecrate," Purification says "therefore let corruption be expelled and truth unified." The passage ensures that what was invoked, ordained, and protected can now endure. Without purification, the bond rests on contaminated ground; with it, the threshold is sanctified for Declaration.',
            'I.5': 'This passage of declaration seals what the four prior movements have prepared. "Thus" binds the logic: witness invoked, order ordained, profanation warned, corruption expelled—therefore the Covenant may endure by right, sustained within the order as established. In calling the Covenant "an everlasting reflection of divine allegiance," the bond is rendered sacred—not a mere arrangement, but something not to be extinguished.'
