/* Lexicon glyph: fully-open must be quiet (no halo, no aura, no glow).

   Purpose:
   - When the panel is fully opened (scroll-lock truth), the glyph should read carved/embedded.
   - Some interaction states can reintroduce text-shadow; we hard-kill it here.

   Scope:
   - Only applies when html.lexicon-scroll-lock is present (panel fully open).
