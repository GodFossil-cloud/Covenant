/* Lexicon seal cover rules (z-layer fix).

   Problem:
   - UI stack surfaces (ToC/Reliquary/Lexicon panels + scrims) are assigned z-indexes by
     assets/ui-stack.js starting at Z_BASE=1500 (step 10).
   - The footer dock is sovereign and typically sits above those surfaces.
   - When Lexicon is open, the Lexicon seal (footer toggle) can be lifted upward into the
     Lexicon header region; if ToC/Reliquary becomes topmost, that lifted seal must not
     remain above the topmost panel.

   Mechanism:
   - ui-stack.js toggles .is-ui-stack-covered on #lexiconToggle when Lexicon is open
     and the topmost surface is ToC or Reliquary.

   Fix:
   - Lower ONLY the Lexicon seal's z-index below the UI stack base while covered.
   - Do not retract, move, or visually restyle the seal; this is purely layering.
