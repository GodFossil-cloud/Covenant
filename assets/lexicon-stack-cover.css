/* Lexicon seal cover rules (ui-stack + translucency fix).

   Context:
   - assets/ui-stack.js assigns z-index to modal surfaces starting at Z_BASE=1500.
   - The footer dock remains sovereign (higher z-index) and can visually sit above scrims.
   - When Lexicon is open and another surface (ToC/Reliquary) becomes topmost, ui-stack.js
     toggles `.is-ui-stack-covered` on #lexiconToggle.

   Important update (Option B):
   - The seal may be re-parented into the Lexicon panel header while the panel is open.
     Therefore, cover rules MUST NOT depend on #navFooter ancestry.

   Why hide (not just z-index):
   - ToC/Reliquary overlays are intentionally translucent.
     If the seal is merely "behind" them, it can still be visible through the veil.

   Behavior:
   - When covered, the seal slides upward out of the viewport and fades to opacity:0.
     (We intentionally do NOT use visibility:hidden in the animated path: some browsers
      apply discrete visibility changes immediately, making the exit look instant.)
   - When uncovered, the seal slides back into place.

   Implementation note:
   - Do NOT animate transform here: the dock seal already uses transform for drag math
     (lexicon.js drives --seal-drag-y, and footer-overrides.css applies translate3d).
   - Animate `top` instead; relative positioning composes cleanly with the existing transform.

   Mobile Safari gotcha:
   - assets/covenant.css sets a max-width:600px rule for #lexiconToggle that overwrites
     `transition` (it only animates transform + color/text/filter).
   - Therefore, we set our transition list with !important so top/opacity animate reliably.
